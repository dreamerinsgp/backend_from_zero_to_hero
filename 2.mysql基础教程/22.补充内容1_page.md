Q1: page概念
在任意时刻，InnoDB能从磁盘（数据文件）传输多少数据到内存（buffer pool）中。 

A unit representing how much data InnoDB transfers at any one time between disk (the data files) and memory (the buffer pool).

一个page能包含一行或多行，具体是取决于每行有多少数据。 
A page can contain one or more rows, depending on how much data is in each row. 
 
如果一行数据太大了，导致一页赛不下， InnoDB会设置额外的指针数据结构来保障行信息能够存储在一页。 
If a row does not fit entirely into a single page, InnoDB sets up additional pointer-style data structures so that the information about the row can be stored in one page.

不需要被查询的字段可以采用压缩格式，这样可以保障一页能存储更多的数据。
One way to fit more data in each page is to use compressed row format. 
For tables that use BLOBs or large text fields, compact row format allows those large columns to be stored separately from the rest of the row, reducing I/O overhead and memory usage for queries that do not reference those columns.

When InnoDB reads or writes sets of pages as a batch to increase I/O throughput, it reads or writes an extent at a time.

All the InnoDB disk data structures within a MySQL instance share the same page size.
